                <h3>Tessolve Semiconductor Pvt. Ltd</h3>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Intern</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 July 2024 - 22 July 2024</p>
                <p>
                    I would like to thank Tessolve Semiconductor Private Limited Company, 
                    JP Nagar, Bangalore for having given me an opportunity to be an intern for a month. 
                    Due to my college schedule, I could join the internship for only a month during my break or holidays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By working as an intern for the company, I could get the work atmosphere exposure and also got 
                    a chance to participate in various events happening within the company. I could actually get an 
                    insight into how the company works.
                </p>
